#"Sweet Ride" The Game

This is a game concept for my daughter, Piper, (who is seven years old).  The mission of the game is to build a candy car.  Here's how the game works:

##First: Select a player.
##Second: Select a body for your candy car.
##Third: Select the candy wheels for your car.
##Fourth: Preview your car.

In the future, we will have more car customization options and hopefully be able to race the cars.  But for now, it is just a car builder.
